    <h1>Developing robust adaptation in co-production with stakeholders</h1>
    <p>While global scenarios inform country-scale decarbonisation plans and targets, in line with the Paris Agreement, adaptation to climate change is often implemented locally with potential trade-offs related to uneven impacts on livelihoods, winners and losers from the transition and interests playing at different policy levels. This learn module explores how to utilise co-production techniques to engage stakeholders in the implementation of robust adaptation plans, compatible with both local higher-level agendas and informed by both global socioeconomic climate scenarios as well as knowledge developed bottom-up from existing local scenarios and adaptation plans. We illustrate how techniques complement each-other in a stepwise manner with concrete examples from two cases in Kenya and the east of the Netherlands. This learn module is targeted at stakeholders interested in co-developing adaptation strategies consistent with the international climate policy.</p>
