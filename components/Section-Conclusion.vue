        <p>The Dutch case study results indicate that both climate adaptation and mitigation are strongly related to the agricultural sector, even if long-term policy targets belong to other themes, such as ‘nature’. This demonstrates the importance to address solutions cross-sectorally and reduce trade-offs that might arise with single-focused strategies. Furthermore, stakeholders clearly identified farmers as leaders in climate adaptation and mitigation across all socioeconomic scenarios (the wildcards), provided that a new agricultural business model within new or expanded regulations is developed. Although socioeconomic changes might evoke different types of farming in the future, its iconic role for the region will remain. The crucial element to enable this role for the farmer is the acceptance of different speeds of developments and initiatives, to eventually transform the system.</p>
        <p>The case study furthermore shows that co-production techniques can successfully be employed and add novel perspectives, despite the existence of a large amount of existing scenarios and adaptation pathways. We applied several different co-production techniques to integrate stakeholder knowledge with scientific knowledge and existing scenarios. In the process, the visualisation of scenarios with wildcards and graphs provided valuable guidance for a solution space. This has enabled the utilisation of global scenarios in a more relevant way for local planning.  With this integration, we co-produced pathways that are robust across socioeconomic scenarios and across climate impacts while being embedded in the local context.</p>
